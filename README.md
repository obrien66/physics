# Physics

It serves the PDF's that are in `public`. I'm trying to make it so it's customizable.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obrien66/physics.git
cd physics
npm install
npm run setup
npm start
```

In `.env`

- `PORT` is responsible for the port on which the server runs
- `URL` is responsible for what directory the site is under
- `TITLE` is responsible for the title at the top of the page
